They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund. We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions. Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.|review|rncjoVoEFUJGCUoC1JgnUA

Chris is our neighbor and has even helped us with our "off-road" stroller when the quick clamp on the front wheel broke on trail 100 at North Mountain! Thanks again!|review|0FNFSzCFP_rGUoJx8W7tJg

My bike had been sitting dormant for a few years and I've made the decision to start riding again.  Chris tuned up the bike and installed new tires, super quick service and reasonable prices.  Two thumbs up for the Bike Doctor!|review|0FNFSzCFP_rGUoJx8W7tJg

There was a blog calling Local Backyard Chicken Farmers, to pool chicken feed volume to make one large purchase for our group, which gave us wholesale prices due to our volume.  It saved everyone involved a significant amount of money.  It is simple and great!  An idea that was meant to come and stay....!  I order chicken feed with the group every two months.\n\nIt is a great organization and I am very happy to have met this group of like-minded people who working together.  If you find yourself to be eco-conscious this FREE community could benefit you too.\n\nA few months in, I have actually been learning quite a bit about health and dietss from some of the members who I have met through VPA.  Great Community and Resource!|review|3f_lyB6vFK48ukH6ScvLHg

I honestly did not realize this was a breakfast joint until we walked by one afternoon. I'm not sure why, but I always thought they were a weight management place of some sort! However, once discovered, we made a mental note to come back...  and so we did a few weekends ago. \n\nThe interior is very nicely done. It's not diner-like, but not trying to be something it isn't either. I like that it's not totally generic like a lot of other breakfast/cafe spots. We walked in for a late breakfast and were seated in a booth right away. The service was excellent and our food was good. I can't say anything really blew me away, but the blueberry pancakes were delicious and the rest of our meal was pretty solid. I'm rounding up to 4 stars for now... we'll certainly be coming back to give this place another go soon.|review|e5gB2kDFaodtxMTa53C29g

Everything was very fresh and flavorful.  Service was superb.\nThe only thing I would complain about is the price $29 for a salad and starter..... come on!   We only drank water....then there's the noise, sit outside if you can.|review|3EEVGDngt4DEhoOQZIUNUw

Once they made it fresh, it was good. Customer service was nothing great, but also not horrible. It would be nice to be able to get a free refill on the fountain soda too.|review|mqQwChPNN4o4DhAzaGntIA

When I heard about this place I was so excited to try it cuz I totally missed good Asian bakery. I was there yesterday and ordered black pepper beef sandwich and they told me they were out of beef. Then I asked if they had curry buns they told they didn't make them anymore. Then I decided to order teriyaki chicken sandwich and it was too salty. I also bought coconut buns and it tasted old and stale. Their milk tea was so chalky and nasty. It kinda made me sick & nauseous after taking few sips I tossed it out. Every freaking thing I ordered was pretty bad and gross. Never going back to that place again.|review|lvM9OzZaZWo1gC8Mwcthjw
